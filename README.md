# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews. In the entertainment industry, understanding consumer mood is crucial for improving content creation, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. Through this project, we aim to analyze and categorize movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.


## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess movie review text data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and understand the distribution of sentiments.
- **Text Vectorization**: Utilize techniques such as TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, or Word2Vec.
- **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models for sentiment analysis, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Display insights and results with visual tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `NLP_Big Data (1).ipynb` file and run the cells step by step.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: Natural Language Processing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset consists of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral). If using an external dataset, please specify the source in the notebook or include instructions on how to obtain it.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**

Detailed analysis and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
